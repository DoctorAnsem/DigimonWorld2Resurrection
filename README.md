# Digimon World 2 Resurrection

Resurrection aims to refactor the experience of the original game, but breathe new life into it through means of massive rebalancing in a non-destructive manner.
It is not meant to replace, but enhance - revitalize the spirit of the original to its fullest potential.

This is done via the following core design philosophies:

- Redesigned all boss battles to be more complex and offer a challenge that will encourage strategic thinking
- Experience rewards scaled in a way that grinding will be a bit more rewarding the more you progress through the game
- Evolutions and DNA tables adjusted and expanded in a way that you have less chances of getting stuck with certain bloodlines
- Retranslated and localized Digimon, skill, item, locations and more, in a manner that tries to preserve the original Japanese meaning
- Digimon skills rebalanced and reworked completely to offer and encourage more versatile builds

### NEW in Resurrection Ver 2.0

- Many script fixes and improvements to remove bugs in the vanilla game, and more streamlined dungeon progression to allow more coherent storytelling at times
- Additional story elements and lore inserted where appropriate, without removing any aspects of the original story 
- Overhauled battle damage calculation across the board:
	- Type advantages decreased from 20% to 5%, as Digimon type is not something you readily have control over at all times
	- Elemental advantages increased from 20% to 50%
	- Tile bonuses increased from 20% to 30%
	- Buffs and debuffs now shift a stat by only 10% each time, capping at +-50%
	- Buffs and debuffs are now correctly removed by skills that reset them
	- Ray Cannon (R Cannon) reworked to stack with other (de)buffs 
	- Ray Cannon's level determines the temporary (de)buff's strength: each level is another 10% to the initial 10% at Lv1
	- Z Cannon respects the new damage calculation and it has been mildly buffed
- Improved visual effects for some techs. We love flair
- Added many new music tracks and variations so that you no longer have to hear the same tracks over and over again for 120 hours
- Visual overhaul of the menu and battle HUD to add some color and decor (I had enough of that toxin green, for one)
- A completely new balance pass for the entire game, adjusting difficulty to scale better for the endgame and catching old bugs that flew under radar
- Slightly improved dungeons:
	- Squashed the most glaring bullshit trap spawns (yes, especially the unkillable Lv3 Return Bugs)
	- Slightly better loot
	- Created some new pathways to some special floors, so you get to pick your poison
	- Relocated dungeons on the overworld map so they don't feel so random/uninspired
- Retranslated some dialogue as well as updated all the terminology in them to finally match the menu entries
- Retranslated all items and key items properly


## INSTRUCTIONS:

You will require a 100% unmodified Digimon World 2 (USA) ROM. For legal reasons, such will not be distributed with this mod, nor will you receive any support in obtaining one - that responsibility is entirely on you, the end user.
Once you have the ROM, use Delta Patcher or any suitable alternative to apply the .xdelta patch provided. This will patch your vanilla Digimon World 2 into Digimon World 2 Resurrection.

The mod has been developed with Duckstation as the medium, with specific settings - images will be provided as to which. This will be the reference point for "optimal" experience.
